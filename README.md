# Computer-Vision-OpenCV-Pillow

In this repo I use OpenCV and Pillow (PIL) techniques useful for image augmentation! 

This includes:

1) Making the background of an image transparent
2) Sharpening of images
3) Rotating images
4) Perspective transformation
5) Overlaying images
6) Saving images and creating their corresponding .txt files (YOLO format)
